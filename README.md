# For future reference, how was this project developed?
This project was started on Codeanywhere, and was pushed to Github using Codeanywhere's terminal, which has git already installed (correct me if I'm wrong).

## Anything important new developers should be aware of?
If you're also using Codeanywhere, be sure to use this account's personal access token (or generate a new token) as the password when Github asks for authentication as you push on Codeanywhere's terminal.

In case you started your Git repository and project files separately on Github, be ready to fix some merge conflicts.
